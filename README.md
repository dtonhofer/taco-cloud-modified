Example code from ["Spring in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-sixth-edition) by Craig Walls, 6th Edition (Manning 2022), modified to my liking.

This code grows & changes as I go through the book.

I will add pages with additional notes when warranted.

Note that this project uses Gradle as build tool, with the Kotlin DSL, instead of Maven as the book does.

I'm using the Intellij IDEA IDE, which may have have various effects on the project structure.
